Collecting a vSCSI Trace

To collect a trace from an application's I/O workload using the vscsiStats utility on an ESX/ESXi host, follow
these steps:

1 Reset the statistics by typing in an ESX/ESXi shell:
vscsiStats -r

2 Start collecting statistics and create a unique ID for them:
vscsiStats -s -t -w <worldId> -i <handleId>

(where <worldId> is the world ID for the virtual machine in which you will be running the workload and
<handleId> is the identifier for the specific virtual disk you will be testing).

3 Using the unique ID generated in the previous step, configure ESX/ESXi to capture the statistics in a disk
file:
logchannellogger <unique-id> <temporary-file-name>

4 Run your application within the virtual machine identified by <worldId>.

5 After the application run is completed (or the trace collection is over) return to the ESX/ESXi shell and stop
the logchannellogger process by typing <Ctrl>-C.

6 Stop the statistics collection:
vscsiStats -x -w <worldId> -i <handleId>

7 Convert the binary trace file to a .csv file:
vscsiStats -e <temporary-file-name> > <trace-file-name.csv>
